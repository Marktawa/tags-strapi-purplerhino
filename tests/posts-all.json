Well, being the helpful folk that we are, we’ve decided to put forward a helpful cribsheet on just that subject!\n\n### The United Kingdom (UK)\n\nThe UK is short for The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland… quite a mouthful! It is a sovereign state (in the same way as France or the USA) but is made up of four countries; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. For Americans, the best analogy would be that the UK is like the USA, whilst its four consistent countries are like states.",

Do you know whether an earl ranks above or below a viscount, or whose children use the title ‘Honorable’?\n\nThis article serves as an introduction to the British peerage*, which has evolved over the centuries into the five ranks that exist today: duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. Earl, the oldest title of the peerage, dates from Anglo-Saxon times.\n\nAfter the [Norman Conquest in 1066](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Norman-Conquest/), William the Conqueror divided the land into manors which he gave to his Norman barons. These barons were summoned by the king from time to time to a Royal Council where they would advise him. By the mid 13th century, the coming together of the barons in this way would form the basis for what we know today as the House of Lords. By the 14th century two distinct Houses of Parliament had emerged: the House of Commons with its representatives from the towns and shires, and the House of Lords with its Lords Spiritual (archbishops and bishops) and Lords Temporal (noblemen).",
